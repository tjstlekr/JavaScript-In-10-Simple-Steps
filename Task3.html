<!--
HOW NOSCRIPT TAG WORKS =
JavaScript-aware browsers will recognize the tag and will honor it by not displaying
the text inside the block. Older, non-JavaScript browsers, on the other hand, will not recognize the
tag as valid HTML. As browsers are supposed to do, they will just ignore the tag they donâ€™t recognize,
but all the content between the opening and closing tags will not be ignored and,
 therefore, will be displayed in the browser.

  // One of the most practical aspects of JavaScript is the ability to output text and
  // HTML into the browser output stream from within your scripts so that the
  // text and HTML appears in the browser as if it were part of the actual HTML of
  // the document. The key to this is document.write()
  document.writeln('<strong>Hey Tejas...</strong>');
  document.write('&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a Nice Day!'); // Because of writeln()

// document.writeln will not work if you skip pre tag
